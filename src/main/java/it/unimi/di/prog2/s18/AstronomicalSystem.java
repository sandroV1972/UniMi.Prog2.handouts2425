/**
 * An astronomical system.
 *
 * <p>An astronomical system is an ordered set of celestial bodies; it is capable of simulating the
 * evolution (of position and velocity) of the celestial bodies contained within it, and of
 * calculating its total energy.
 *
 * <p>The intended use of this class is:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>create an astronomical system;
 *   <li>add a list of celestial bodies to it;
 *   <li>perform the simulation;
 *   <li>calculate the total energy.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The method {@link #add(CelestialBody)} does not make a copy of the celestial body, therefore
 * if the celestial body is modified after being added, the behavior of the astronomical system is
 * undefined. The last two steps can be repeated to know the intermediate state of the simulation;
 * conversely, adding celestial bodies after the start of the simulation makes the behavior of the
 * astronomical system undefined.
